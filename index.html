"You could paint something, play the guitar, learn to play the guitar, write a book, take a nap, watch a good movie, eat some fries, learn how to make candles, drink some water, plant flowers, wash your hands, pet some kittens, befriend a sentient roll of toilet paper, play Candyland, befriend an insecure celery stalk who can’t accept that he tastes bad, adopt a guinea pig, make sure theres toilet paper before you go in to take a poo, foresight folks. . . . So yeah, anyways theres lots to do."</p>
